Step 3: Set Tesseract Path
Update the pytesseract.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd variable in the code with the correct path to your Tesseract OCR executable. Modify this line:
pytesseract.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd = r'C:\Program Files (x86)\Tesseract-OCR\tesseract.exe'
Ensure the path is correct for your system.
Step 4: Run the Program
Save the provided code in a file, e.g., chat.py. 
Open a terminal or command prompt in the directory containing the script and run:
Terminal:  streamlit run document_search_chat.py
This command will start a local development server and open the application in your default web browser. You can interact with the document search and chat system through the provided interfaces.
